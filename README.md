# Calculator App
This is a calculator application that offers some functions in addition to those of a simple calculator, such
as factorial and calculations with Euler number and trigonometric basic functions, the main screen model was
based on an application by Ivan Rodrigues: https://github.com/ivanrmoura/Calculadora-Kotlin-Android
In addition to the basic functions of a calculator taught in the video lesson, a history system was 
implemented, adding new features and modifying results display modes.
